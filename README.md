   * [JSON .NET For Unity - v2.0.1](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347)

Please note that when lichess3d is built, the resulting binary is covered by the lichess3d license mentioned above.

Please refer to the Unity Asset Store page for each Asset to find their licensing terms.
